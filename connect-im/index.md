# Tutorial: connect-im

`connect-im` is a microservice for **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.
It allows managing *digital identities* (Users, API Keys) and *groups* (Organizations)
within isolated environments called **Spaces** (which are Keycloak Realms).
The system uses **Keycloak** as its core identity engine.
Functionalities are exposed via **F2 Functions** (an API layer).
Access control is handled through **Privilege Management** (defining Roles, Permissions, and Features)
and enforced by a **Policy Enforcement** layer.
**Configuration & Initialization Scripts** automate the setup of Spaces and their initial state.
